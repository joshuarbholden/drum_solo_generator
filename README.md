# drum_solo_generator
 
Currently a messy bunch of Maple files.

TO DO:  
* clean up
     * especially, delete stuff that is not being used
* translate into an open source language, like Julia  
     * I'd be more than happy to have help from anyone!
* separate 8th note from 16th note styles
* re-organize ride patterns based on rhythm and on instrumentation
* extensions
