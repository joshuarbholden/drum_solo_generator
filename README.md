# drum_solo_generator
 
~~Currently a messy bunch of Maple files.~~  Now a messy bunch of Julia files!

TO DO:  
* clean up
     * especially, delete stuff that is not being used
* translate into an open source language, like Julia  (mostly done now)
     * I'd be more than happy to have help from anyone!
* separate 8th note from 16th note styles (done?)
* re-organize ride patterns based on rhythm and on instrumentation (done?)
* shuffle beats
* ghost notes
* extensions
